					<p>Project is mostly completed. It should be tested and debugged, even if there might be some optimalization left to be done.</p>
					<p>Later today, we are scheduled for it's advocacy. We still have to make our final reports (only I have completed mine as of yet).</p>
					<p>Full overview of the project can be found at it's wiki (link is in the header).</p>

					<p>The main purpose of this project is to visualize Camel route configuration.</p>
					<p>First step was to create a parser that is able to parse route from Camel file. Most basic version of it is already finished and more advanced one is in works.</p>
					<p>Next step is generating SVG images that visualize routes parsed from Camel file. When finished, we should be able to generate three different boards (RasPi B+, BeagleBoneBlack and CubieBoard 2) and also every needed component.</p>
					<p>After that, next step is creating graphical interface so this funcionality can be used effectively. When we have first prototype of application working, we will work on testing and possibly adding more features.</p>
					<p>Currently, not all roles are fully fleshed out and assigned, but Norbert Slivka is working on aforementioned parser and Martin Zilak is beggining his work on the SVG generator.</p>
