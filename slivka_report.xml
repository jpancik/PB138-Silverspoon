<title>Final Report</title>
<simpara>My work was on the parser module resposible for converting the Apache Camel document to our custom Java structure.</simpara>
<simpara>It was designed with strong emphasis on scalability. Any change can be introduced to the system in small time period and should not require much testing. The parser is currently capable of parsing any route starting from a pin or nowhere and ending in ethernet, as was the case in specification delivered to us.</simpara>
<simpara>It provides other developers with API expandable far beyond the specification if needed.</simpara>
