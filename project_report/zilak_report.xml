<title>Final Report</title>
<simpara>My job was drawing boards and drawing routes in them. I was given a parsed route and I had to determine whether it starts on a specific pin or just on a pin header (the information was already in that parsed route, but I had to define different approach for each). For clarity, I decided that lines from starting point and to end point will be dashed, other ones will be solid.</simpara>
<simpara>Route can currently only end in ethernet or nowhere (this was in our assignment), but with my structure it should be fairly easy to add other types of starts/endings and this should be possible to do in a span of few hours including debugging. In order to accomodate the width of the route, the board can stretch in width. Because of this, I had to figure out how to always have correct positions of movable objects. I solved this by parsing my own SVG. This approach should make it easier to change things around without having to worry if it won't break something.</simpara>
<simpara>Because I couldn't find any SVG templates of the boards that were in acceptable quality (mainly because of poor code structure), I had to study and draw all of the boards by myself. This turned out to be quite handy, since I had very good overview of the SVG structure and it was easy for me to work with. I also used it to learn SVG, so I solved two problems at once.</simpara>
