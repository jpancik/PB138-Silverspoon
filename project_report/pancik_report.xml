<title>Final Report</title>
<simpara>My job as a team leader was to assing tasks to each team member (in reality, we just agreed on who wanted to do what). I had to coordinate the project, start our repository and keep everything in order. I was also responsible for GUI part of our project.</simpara>
<simpara>I did this in Swing, since it's simple and multiplatform. I decided to go with simple yet effective design, since I think that's the best it can be. There are two ways of loading Camel Route file - load a file or use text input field. Then you just select a board you want to work with and press "Generate".</simpara>
<simpara>If something happens, program promptly informs you about it, but leaves the Route file loaded so you don't have to look for it again. If everything works as it should, your browser opens with drawn board in SVG placed in simple HTML template, from where you can easily save it. I chose this solution since it's the easiest one to work with.</simpara>
